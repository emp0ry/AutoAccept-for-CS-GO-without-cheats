# CS:GO AutoAccept without Cheats!

This is not a cheat, this just utilises the -netconport launch option which allows for applications to connect to the game's console and read and send console commands.

## How it's working?
  - using console logs detecting match and bringing cs:go to the front and clicking the accept button
  - works when you are not in cs:go
  - works in fullscreen mode

## setup for main.py
- add the launch option `-netconport 2121` to csgo
