# AutoAccept for CS:GO without cheats
### How it's working?
• Working only in windowed mode <br/>
• The script takes a screenshot of the csgo window and when the accept game button appears, it turns into csgo and presses the button and then it will go back to the program you were in <br/>
• PS: For first time run 3-4 time main.py
