# CS:GO AutoAccept without Cheats!

This is not a cheat, this just utilises the -netconport launch option which allows for applications to connect to the game's console and read and send console commands.

## setup for main.py
- add the launch option `-netconport 2121` to csgo
- working in fullscreen mode :)

## Bugs
- doesn't work when you're in csgo only if csgo is minimized
